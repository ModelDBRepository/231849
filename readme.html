<p>is in the file Listing_TBCAS.sp<br/>
This file was contributed by Paolo Massobrio.

Note from the ModelDB Administrator:<br/>
Although the file was developed with HSPICE it was found to also run under the
free ngspice available from sourceforge for all major platforms (linux/unix, mac, mswin):<p/>
<a href="http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/docs.html">http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/docs.html</a>
<p/>You can run the default simulation with a command like (after the sourceforge pkg binary for the mac was installed):<p/>

 /Applications/ngspice/bin/ngspice -a -r output1.dat Listing_TBCAS.sp 
<p/>
And then at the spice command prompt type the following:<p/>
...<br/>
ngspice 1 -> plot -v(840)<br/>
ngspice 2 -> plot -v(940)<br/>
ngspice 3 -><br/>
<p/>
(I found the minus sign provides the same orientation as the solid black and red traces in figure 2 in the paper.  The mV units labeled in the graphs below are apparently a typo because if microVolts instead, the traces match the paper.
